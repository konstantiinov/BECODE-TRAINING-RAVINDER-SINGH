# **RAVINDER SINGH** - *JUNIOR WEB DEVELOPER*

I am young 26 year old who has just embarked upon his journey to becoming a Junior Web Developer. I've lived in Belgium for most of my life,however I would struggle to attach myself to one country given that I'm of a mixed ethnic background and have grown up in the very multi-cultural environment that International Schools are. As such I've had the privilage to encounter people and cultures from all over the globe. I believe that this makes me somewhat of an international citizen.

### My 3 most surprising skills:

- Ability to function on 2 hours of sleep as well as sleeping for over 15 hours.
- Photographic memory when it comes to names and faces.
- I can name the capital city of nearly every country in the world.

### Heres a list of the 3 things I like the most in the universe (in no particular order):

- Women
- Sports
- Chilling in my bed

The main objective that I would like to achieve at as a developer at BeCode is to become proficient enough in writing code and having sufficent knowledge of the different coding languages in order to be qualified enough to work as a fullstack developer.

My greatest fear is to find myself in a situation where I am not fully prepared to be competetive in the job market after having completed this formation.

The things I look most forward to is expanding my knowledge and understanding in this domain and working in collaboration with the others, as the latter will be an essential skill to have.I also look forward to using this opportunity to perfect my French.

### The three things I value the most when it comes to working as a group are:
- Communication
- Patience
- Everyone contributing their best efforts
